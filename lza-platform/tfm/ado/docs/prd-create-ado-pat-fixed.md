## Executive Summary

This PRD defines requirements for an automated solution to create Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in Azure DevOps, replacing a manual 12-step process with programmatic automation. The solution addresses the need for "token-1" creation as part of the Azure Landing Zone Terraform Accelerator deployment process.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

Users must manually navigate through Azure DevOps portal to create PATs with specific scopes:

- Navigate to <https://dev.azure.com> → organization → user settings → personal access tokens
- Create new token with specific name and expiration
- Select 9 specific permission scopes from a complex UI
- Manually copy and securely store the generated token

### Pain Points

- Time-consuming manual process (12+ steps)
- Error-prone scope selection
- Inconsistent token naming and expiration settings
- Security risk from manual token handling
- No automation capability for CI/CD scenarios

## Solution Overview

Develop a PowerShell-based automation suite that uses Azure DevOps REST APIs to programmatically create PATs with predefined scopes, eliminating manual steps while maintaining security best practices.

## Instruction Prompts for Artifact Generation

  * Agent Pools: Read & manage (vso.agent_management)
  * Build: Read & execute (vso.build_execute)
  * Code: Full (vso.code_full)
  * Environment: Read & manage (vso.environment_manage)
  * Graph: Read & manage (vso.graph_manage)
  * Pipeline Resources: Use & manage (vso.pipelineresources_manage)
  * Project and Team: Read, write & manage (vso.project_manage)
